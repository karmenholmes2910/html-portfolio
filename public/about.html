<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Karmen Holmes and I live in Fort Worth, Texas. I am married and have 3 children and 2 dogs.</p>

<p>I went to school at Southwestern Adventist University in Keene, Texas where I obtained my BSN in Nursing in 2018. 
  I currently work at Texas Health Resources in the Emergency Room in Fort Worth, Texas; I also work as a Registered Nurse Certified Asethetic Injector at 
Club Inject in Southlake, Texas. I have worked in healthcare for the last 9 years which also includes 2.5 years of travel Nursing
in various states across the country.</p>

<p>Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my family, traveling and going on new adventures.
  My current goal is the transition from healthcare to IT to have not only a productive creative outlet, but a career that will also allow me to spend more time with my family.</p>
